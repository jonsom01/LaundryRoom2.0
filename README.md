# LaundryRoom2.0

It's an application that handles bookings for a laundry room. It's designed to have an "analog" feeling. When you click on an empty space,and press your code, your "bolt" turns up in that space, and that means you've booked that time.

Set up:

1. Download the whole project and open it using VS 2017.
2. Create your own database using EF code first (or set one up manually (check the models for requirements)).
3. Add your db connection string to your appsettings.json, and an api key to SendGrid.
4. Manually add an admin user to the db in order to use the website to create users.
